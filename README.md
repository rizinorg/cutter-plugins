## Decompilers

### [Ghidra Decompiler](https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra)
This is an integration of the Ghidra decompiler for Cutter and rizin. It is solely based on the decompiler part of Ghidra, which is written entirely in C++, so neither Ghidra itself nor JAVA are required at all and the plugin can be built self-contained.

Due to its quality, the ghidra decompiler plugin is shipped by default in Cutter releases.

**Type**: Plugin  
**Status**: Maintained  

### [RetDec Decompiler](https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-retdec)
The plugin integrates RetDec decompiler into Cutter.

With the bundled version of RetDec you can decompile the following architectures:

   - 32-bit: Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, PIC32, and PowerPC.
   - 64-bit: x86-64, ARM64 (AArch64).
  
**Type**: Plugin

### [jsdec](https://github.com/rizinorg/jsdec)
JSdec converts the assembly of a function to a Pseudo-C code. Cutter integrates jsdec by default. 

**Type**: Plugin

## Malware Analysis


### [APT32 Graph Deobfuscator](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/Cyber-Research/blob/master/Malware/APT32/APT32GraphDeobfuscator.py)
A plugin for Cutter and Radare2 to deobfuscate APT32 flow graphs
This is a python plugin for Cutter that is compatible as an r2pipe script for
radare2 as well. The plugin will help reverse engineers to deobfuscate and remove
junk blocks from APT32 (Ocean Lotus) samples.

**Type**: Plugin

**Status**: WIP  


## Enhancements

### [CutterRef](https://github.com/yossizap/cutterref)

Cutter Full Instruction Reference Plugin. The plugin will monitor the location for your cursor and display the full documentation of the instruction. At the moment it only supports x86-64, ARM and MIPS 32bit, however adding support for other architectures is relatively easy.

**Type**: Plugin  
**Status**: Maintained

### [Assembly-reference](https://github.com/daringjoker/Assembly-refrence)
